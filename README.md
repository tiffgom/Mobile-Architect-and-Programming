### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. 
#### What user needs was this app designed to address?
According to the requirements, this application is an event tracker and is meant to provide user login and an event list dashboard with CRUD operations on data stored in SQLite databases for both user and event information. Users may also enable a feature to receive SMS notifications for upcoming events.
### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? 
#### How did your UI designs keep users in mind?

#### Why were your designs successful?

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? 
#### What techniques or strategies did you use? 
I heavily modularized the application through the use of multiple classes to separate activity screens and functionality. I used coding best practices, simplified code structure to keep it legible and clean, used logical naming conventions, and commenting to explain portions of code.
#### How could those be applied in the future?
### How did you test to ensure your code was functional?
A phone emulator was used for testing and real-time adjustments, particularly regarding the UI design and structure. Using this strategy, I was able to mimic the navigation on an Android phone in a manner similar to a user and make minor UI and code modifications in order to improve the user experience and the aesthetic appeal of the application.
#### Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In creating the app's user interface (UI), I had to make several modifications in order to create a design that would attract my chosen user demographic. My initial design improved as I better grasped the material to include additional CRUD functionality like a delete all function. Viewing the final product from the user's perspective inspired me to create an overflow menu option with logout and switch user options instead of a simple logout icon button. 
### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particulary successful in creating two SQLite databases to store user and event data and developing as well as the subsequent CRUD operations for each. Multiple users may create accounts with unique credentials that are stored and checked against the database at login as well as retrieve stored forgotten passwords. Existing, at each login, can view their current event lists, create new events, and modify or delete existing events. Their current list is always stored at log out and retrieved at log in.
